abstract = {We will give an algorithm for computing generators of the invariant ring for a given representation of a linearly reductive group. The algorithm basically consists of a single Gröbner basis computation. We will also show a connection between some open conjectures in commutative algebra and finding good degree bounds for generating invariants.},
